Workflow is a utility to model logic-driven, state-based workflows. Workflow is used to define a series of steps where step progression can change dynamically. One sequence of work exists as an exterior index for the end-user (in the interface) and an interior index to control a more complex process flow. A workflow is an object which encapsulates all logic related to a set of steps and so provides helper methods to query the state of the flow, to support easy interface control for templates.

## Install

Install with npm.

```sh
npm install --save @adaptiveui/workflow
```

Install with bower.

```sh
bower install --save adaptiveui-workflow
```

### Lodash Dependency

This library requires all of lodash. It only imports the methods it needs, supporting use of [rollup.js](http://rollupjs.org/) or [lodash-modularize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash-modularize).

## Quick Usage

```js
import workflow from "adaptiveui/workflow"

var flow = workflow(['one', 'two', 'three']);

// many is* methods to control interface state
assert(flow.current() === 'one');
assert(flow.isBeforeLast() === true);

// next will return the next value and advance the internal index
assert(flow.index === 0);
assert(flow.next() === 'two');
assert(flow.index === 1);
```

## Usage

### Workflow API

#### Initialize a Workflow

A Workflow can progress over the following types:

* `integer` which is converted to an array `[0, 1, 2, 3, ..., <integer>]`
* `array`
* `object`

```js
assert((workflow(3)).size() === 3);
assert((workflow([2, 3, 4])).size() === 3);
assert((workflow({ '3':4, '5':4, '1':2 })).size() === 3);
```

#### Moving through a Workflow

A Workflow keeps track of an internal index. By default a workflow maps it's index directly to the underlying source. With an array workflow, if `index = 2`, the `current()` you return the item at index 2.

```js
var flow = workflow([2, 3, 4]);

flow.firstIndex() === 0;       // always 0
flow.lastIndex() === 2;        // last index of an array of 3
flow.index === 0;              // defaults to 0
flow.isFirst() === true;       // index is at 0 which is first
flow.isLast() === false;       // index is at 0 which is not the last
flow.isAfterFirst() === false  // index is at first, so it cannot be after it
flow.isBeforeLast() === true   // index is less than lastIndex()
```

These methods are most useful in a template, this example uses an imaginary templating language.

```html
<section class="wizard">
  {{ customViewAtIndex(flow.index) }}
  <button *-show="flow.isAfterFirst()">Previous</button>
  <button *-show="flow.isBeforeLast()"
          *-click="flow.next()">
    Next
  </button>
</section>
```

A Workflow bounds the index.

```js
var flow = workflow([2, 3, 4]);

flow.index = 1;
flow.index === 1;
// assign an index under the first index, so we set to first
flow.index = -3;     
flow.index === 0;
// assign an index over the last index, so we set to last
flow.index = 6;      
flow.index === 2;
// assign a non-numerical index, leave the index at the same location
flow.index = 'as';   
flow.index === 2;
```

#### Workflows of Objects

The object stored at the index can be retrieved too.

```js
var flow = workflow(['two', 'three', 'four']);

flow.current() === 'two';  // defaults to 'two'
flow.peekFirst() === 'two';    // always the first object
flow.peekLast() === 'four';     // always the last object
```

#### Workflow Size

The size of the object being progressed over.

```js
var flow = workflow([2, 3, 4]);

flow.length === 3;
flow.size() === 3;
```

### Workflow Scenarios

The following example(s) demonstrate the power of a workflow and usefulness of managing two indices.

#### Form Validation

Every page/view within a multi-part form should have a validation method.

```js
var flow = workflow({
  'step1': {    
    // NOTE 'step1' is not valid, so the rule will keep the workflow at index 0
    isValid: function() { return false; },
    content: {}
  },
  'step2': {    
    isValid: function() { return true; },
    content: {}
  }
});

// Rule: if the current view is not valid, assign the flow to the current flow
flow.reflow(function(requestedIndex, requestedItem) {
  if (!this.current().isValid()) {
    return this.index;
  }
});

flow.next(); // same as flow.index = 1 (or any other index)
flow.index === 0; // the valid method at index 0, prevents progression
```

#### User Permission

A workflow can be used to construct the steps presented to an end-user.

```js
var flow = workflow({
  'step1': {
    isPermitted: true,
    content: {}
  },
  'step2': {
    isPermitted: false,
    content: {}
  },
  'step3': {
    isPermitted: true,
    content: {}
  }
});

// Rule: Scan to next/previous permitted item
flow.reflow(function(requestedIndex) {

  return this.scanIndex(function(scanIndex, scanItem) {
    return scanItem.isPermitted;
  }, (requestedIndex < this.index) ? -1 : 1);

});

flow.next();
flow.next();
flow.index === 2; // it scanned to the next permitted item and not beyond

flow.previous();
flow.previous();
flow.index === 0; // it scanned to the previous permitted item and not beyond
```
