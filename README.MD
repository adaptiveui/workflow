Workflow is a utility to model logic-driven, state-based, user-driven workflows. Workflow is used to define a flow of work where steps in that flow change dynamically. One sequence of work exists as an exterior index for the end-user (in the interface) and an interior index to control a more complex procesflow.

## Install

Install with npm.

```sh
npm install --save @adaptiveui/workflow
```

Install with bower.

```sh
bower install --save adaptiveui-workflow
```

## Quick Usage

```js
import workflowAUI from "adaptiveui/workflow"

var flow = workflowAUI(['one', 'two', 'three']);

// many is* methods to control interface state
assert(flow.current() === 'one');
assert(flow.isBeforeLast() === true);

// next will return the next value and advance the internal index
assert(flow.index === 0);
assert(flow.next() === 'two');
assert(flow.index === 1);
```

## Usage

### Initialize a Workflow

A Workflow can progress over the following types:

* `integer` which is converted to an array `[0, 1, 2, 3, ..., <integer>]`
* `array`
* `object`

```js
assert((workflowAUI(3)).size() === 3);
assert((workflowAUI([2, 3, 4])).size() === 3);
assert((workflowAUI({ '3':4, '5':4, '1':2 })).size() === 3);
```

#### Moving through a Workflow

A Workflow keeps track of an internal index. By default a workflow maps it's index directly to the underlying source. With an array workflow, if `index = 2`, the `current()` you return the item at index 2.

```js
var flow = workflowAUI([2, 3, 4]);

flow.firstIndex() === 0;       // always 0
flow.lastIndex() === 2;        // last index of an array of 3
flow.index === 0;              // defaults to 0
flow.isFirst() === true;       // index is at 0 which is first
flow.isLast() === false;       // index is at 0 which is not the last
flow.isAfterFirst() === false  // index is at first, so it cannot be after it
flow.isBeforeLast() === true   // index is less than lastIndex()
```

A Workflow bounds the index.

```js
var flow = workflowAUI([2, 3, 4]);

flow.index = 1;
flow.index === 1;
// assign an index under the first index, so we set to first
flow.index = -3;     
flow.index === 0;
// assign an index over the last index, so we set to last
flow.index = 6;      
flow.index === 2;
// assign a non-numerical index, leave the index at the same location
flow.index = 'as';   
flow.index === 2;
```

#### Objects

The object stored at the index can be retrieved too.

```js
var flow = workflowAUI(['two', 'three', 'four']);

flow.current() === 'two';  // defaults to 'two'
flow.peekFirst() === 'two';    // always the first object
flow.peekLast() === 'four';     // always the last object
```

#### Size

The size of the object being progressed over.

```js
var flow = workflowAUI([2, 3, 4]);

flow.length === 3;
flow.size() === 3;
```
