Workflow defines a workflow of logic-drive events. A workflow manager for interfaces which helps controlling the state of interface elements. In advanced scenarios, a workflow maps an exterior workflow (for the user) and an interior workflow (which drives an internal process); useful for providing a simple step control for users of a complex process.

## Install

```sh
npm i -D adaptiveui\workflow
```

## Example

```js
import workflowAUI from "adaptiveui/workflow"

var workflow = workflowAUI(['one', 'two', 'three']);

// many is* methods to control interface state
assert(workflow.current() === 'one');
assert(workflow.isBeforeLast() === true);

// next will return the next value and advance the internal index
assert(workflow.index === 0);
assert(workflow.next() === 'two');
assert(workflow.index === 1);
```

## Usage


### Initialize a Workflow

A Workflow can progress over the following types:

* `integer` which is converted to an array `[0, 1, 2, 3, ..., <integer>]`
* `array`
* `object`

```js
assert((workflowAUI(3)).size() === 3);
assert((workflowAUI([2, 3, 4])).size() === 3);
assert((workflowAUI({ '3':4, '5':4, '1':2 })).size() === 3);
```

#### Moving through a Workflow

A workflow keeps track from an internal index. By default a workflow maps it's index directly to the underlying source. With an array workflow, if `index = 2`, the `current()` you return the item at index 2.

```js
var s = workflowAUI([2, 3, 4]);

s.firstIndex() === 0;       // always 0
s.lastIndex() === 2;        // last index of an array of 3
s.index === 0;              // defaults to 0
s.isFirst() === true;       // index is at 0 which is first
s.isLast() === false;       // index is at 0 which is not the last
s.isAfterFirst() === false  // index is at first, so it cannot be after it
s.isBeforeLast() === true   // index is less than lastIndex()
```

A Workflow bounds the index.

```js
var s = workflowAUI([2, 3, 4]);

s.index = 1;
s.index === 1;

s.index = -3;     // under, so we set to first
s.index === 0;

s.index = 6;      // over, so we set to last
s.index === 2;

s.index = 'as';   // not, a number so we do not change the value
s.index === 2;
```

#### Objects

The object stored at the index can be retrieved too.

```js
var s = workflowAUI(['two', 'three', 'four']);

s.current() === 'two';  // defaults to 'two'
s.peekFirst() === 'two';    // always the first object
s.peekLast() === 'four';     // always the last object
```

#### Size

The size of the object being progressed over.

```js
var s = workflowAUI([2, 3, 4]);

s.length === 3;
s.size() === 3;
```
